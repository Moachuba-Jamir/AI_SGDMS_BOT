These sensors use sound waves to detect the distance between the sensor and the top of the waste pile. The difference in distance helps calculate how much space is left in the bin. Data Collection: The sensors send real-time data to the system about the waste levels, allowing for constant monitoring without the need for manual checks. Data Processing and Reporting: The system can send alerts to the admin panel to trigger alerts to waste collection drivers when a bin reaches a certain fill level threshold, ensuring timely collection and avoiding overflow or littering. Remote Monitoring: Waste level data is accessible remotely via a central web or mobile application, allowing waste management authorities or city administrators to monitor bins in real time from anywhere. Real-Time Updates: hen bins are nearing capacity, alerts are sent to the designated waste collection teams, prompting them to schedule a pickup"}]}
